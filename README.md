# Gaming-Analysis BC_ISYS3340

##### Our group notices that many video games in the market quickly lose customers’ interests and demand while companies want to have a solid base of fans to enhance their profits. This situation is somehow reasonable and expected because there are a number of alternatives that stimulate customers’ interests and curiosity, and as time passes by, players become so familiar with their old games that it no longer makes them excited. However, there are games like Final Fantasy, Counter-Strike, The Legend of Zelda, and Grand Theft Auto, which have long-lasting popularity and players’ loyalty. As a result, our group starts to wonder why some video games can still attract gamers’ loyalty and attention while others completely fail to do so. However, when we research over the factors that make these games long-lasting on the Internet, the answers provided are somehow vague and subjective with a lack of quantitative evidence. Therefore, our group decides to do data analysis and build the new model to resolve this problem using publicly available information. For our team’s final project, we are going to analyze the video games that both succeed financially and receive highly positive reviews from gamers as well as media companies on multiple platforms such as consoles, PC, or mobile devices and developed companies of different scales. Our goal is to discover commonalities among these popular video games and build a machine learning tool that receives budget as an input and outputs game features that will help gaming firms have an optimal number of copies sold.
